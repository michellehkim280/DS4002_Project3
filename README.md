## Documentation Map
### 1) SCRIPTS - This folder includes our source code for the project with detailed comments outlining the actions being taken to analyze the data and use it for modeling.
- P3_Image_EDA.R - This file goes through the training data to visualize image and mask data, understand image structure, as well as observe pixel intensity value distribution.
- Secondary EDA.R - This file alsp goes through the training data of both images and masks, analyzing pixel intensity value distribution of both the images and masks more in depth.

### 2) DATA - This folder holds our raw data, which was also used during analysis. 
- AMAZON: Initial and final dataset folder containing 3 folders (Test, Training, Validation), of which contain hundreds of GeoTIFF Amazon forest satellite images. 
  
### 3) OUTPUT - This folder includes the output of our analysis, including charts and graphs to support or oppose our hypothesis.
